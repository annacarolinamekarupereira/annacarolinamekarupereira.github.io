                <p>I'm currently living in Sydney and working with the Events industry.
                    From
                    conferences to weddings
                    I'm always working hard to deliver the best guest experience. I have a beautiful rescued greyhound
                    named Archie
                    and volunteer when possible to help rescued animals. I'm currently fostering two puppies
                    for <a href="https://www.jadesdogrescue.com/available-for-adoption">Jades Rescue </a>who are the
                    cutest little dinossaurs.

                <p>
                    I have previously studied Software Development and Analysis and worked for a year on the fields.
                    Came to Australia to live the dream of living abroad once I finished my studies. Started working
                    with the hospitality industry since then, more specifically with Events. Although I love events I
                    decided to give another chance to Development and see where it takes me.

                    By the end of this course I hope to be more confident with the skills and find an introductory job
                    to start with.
